        How awesome is the graphic design artist, <a class="link" href="http://www.nightowltiajasmin.com/" alt="NightOwlTiaJasmin" title="NightOwlTiaJasmin">Tia Jasmin</a>,
        who designed the <a class="link" href="/" alt="954live" title="954live">954live</a> logo,

        you just want to find some upcoming <a href="/genres/rock" alt="Rock" title="Rock">Rock</a> concerts. We are active on

        Fort Lauderdale used to be rocking town. Recently bands coming through town were not getting the support they deserve.
        This website was inspired from the pain realizing way too late Walk the Moon played at the
        <a href="/venues/fort-lauderdale/culture-room" alt="Culture Room" title="Culture Room">Culture Room</a> and it is a vow to
        never miss an awesome band again because we didn't know they were playing local. All other questions can be asked by using the
